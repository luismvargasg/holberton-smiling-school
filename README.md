### Description

In this project, I implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. I use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledge that I learned previously at Holberton School.

### Layouts

I started this projects with the next mockups.

The first 3 ones are the tablet version, and the ones at the bottom are the mobile version.

Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px and switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
